# Mobile Order Mock

A Laravel demo project styled with Tailwind CSS and bundled with Vite.

## Getting started

1. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
2. Install Node dependencies and compile assets:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   For production builds run `npm run build`.
3. Serve the application with Artisan:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve --port=8001
   ```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8001 while the Vite dev server handles asset compilation.
